SMACR was developed for the Steiniger Lab at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.  Its primary function is the identification and analysis of small RNAs in relation to annotated features of a genome.  As is, SMACR is written for the <i>Drosophila</i> genome.  Using it yourself will require a little work, but a generalized version for download is forthcoming.
